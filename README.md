# Git Branching Demo: Multi-Page Website

Welcome! This repository serves as a hands-on laboratory for understanding **Git Branching**. Instead of just looking at a finished product, you can "time travel" through the development of a mockup website by switching between different branches.

## 💡 The Concept

Each branch represents a specific milestone in the development of this site. We follow a **Start/Finish** pattern:
* **`-start`**: The "scaffolding" or empty state of a feature.
* **`-finish`**: The polished, final version of that feature.
